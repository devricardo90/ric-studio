RIC-STUDIO-003B - Diagnose Commit-Allow Overblocking

## Product mode

Local-first.

## MVP mode

Documentation and operational control only.

## Official agents

- RIC Architect: discussion, scope, architecture, and task design.
- RIC Local Orchestrator: evidence, validation, commit and push gate, and state control.

## Official states

- Discussion Gate.
- READY.
- IN_PROGRESS.
- Local DONE.
- Remote DONE.

## Runtime authority

`ric-orchestrator-runtime:latest` is the official local orchestration runtime.

## Review note

RIC-STUDIO-001 is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `aa8a6d3`.

RIC-STUDIO-002 is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `b81ac6b`.

RIC-STUDIO-003A is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `07e11f1`.

Batch result: 3 PASS, 1 FAIL. PASS: LO-SMOKE-001, LO-SMOKE-005, LO-SMOKE-006. FAIL: LO-SMOKE-003.

Conclusion: `ric-orchestrator-runtime:latest` correctly blocked missing-evidence commit, allowed controlled push, and blocked Remote DONE when HEAD != origin/main, but failed the positive commit-allow scenario by overblocking.

RIC-STUDIO-003B is in Local DONE. READY remains empty. Remote DONE for RIC-STUDIO-003B is blocked until commit, push, and post-push evidence.

Diagnosis result: 2 PASS, 3 FAIL. The model overblocked COMMIT-ALLOW-001, COMMIT-ALLOW-002, and COMMIT-ALLOW-003; it passed only the rule-explicit positive case and the negative control.

A future system prompt or Modelfile correction is recommended but was not executed in this task.
