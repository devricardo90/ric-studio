## Task

RIC-STUDIO-009A - Promote Candidate Runtime To Official Runtime

## Product mode

Local-first.

## MVP mode

Documentation and operational control only.

## Official agents

- RIC Architect: discussion, scope, architecture, and task design.
- RIC Local Orchestrator: evidence, validation, commit and push gate, and state control.

## Official states

- Discussion Gate.
- READY.
- IN_PROGRESS.
- Local DONE.
- Remote DONE.

## Runtime authority

`ric-orchestrator-runtime:latest` is the official local orchestration runtime.

## Review note

RIC-STUDIO-001 is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `aa8a6d3`.

RIC-STUDIO-002 is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `b81ac6b`.

RIC-STUDIO-003A is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `07e11f1`.

Batch result: 3 PASS, 1 FAIL. PASS: LO-SMOKE-001, LO-SMOKE-005, LO-SMOKE-006. FAIL: LO-SMOKE-003.

Conclusion: `ric-orchestrator-runtime:latest` correctly blocked missing-evidence commit, allowed controlled push, and blocked Remote DONE when HEAD != origin/main, but failed the positive commit-allow scenario by overblocking.

RIC-STUDIO-003B is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `e67a0e5`.

Diagnosis result: 2 PASS, 3 FAIL. The model overblocked COMMIT-ALLOW-001, COMMIT-ALLOW-002, and COMMIT-ALLOW-003; it passed only the rule-explicit positive case and the negative control.

A future system prompt or Modelfile correction is recommended but was not executed in this task.

RIC-STUDIO-004B is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `bfa6519`.

During RIC-STUDIO-004B, no candidate model was created, no official runtime tag was promoted, and no model behavior was tested.

The clean versioned runtime source was created at `runtime/ric-orchestrator/Modelfile`.

RIC-STUDIO-005A is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `6610991`.

Candidate runtime `ric-orchestrator-candidate:005a` was created from `runtime/ric-orchestrator/Modelfile` and validated locally. The official runtime was not promoted or overwritten.

RIC-STUDIO-006A is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `8e3796a`.

Behavioral smoke tests against `ric-orchestrator-candidate:005a` completed with 6 PASS and 0 FAIL for the required gate decisions. The candidate fixed the previous positive commit-allow overblocking in the tested scenarios. The candidate was not promoted.

RIC-STUDIO-007A is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `f4a16cc`.

Realistic workflow simulation against `ric-orchestrator-candidate:005a` completed with 7 PASS and 0 FAIL. The candidate was not promoted. Recommendation: promote the candidate in a separate controlled promotion task after Trigger review.

RIC-STUDIO-008A is Remote DONE and synchronized with `origin/main` at commit `54c7f78`.

Versioned runtime vocabulary was standardized in `runtime/ric-orchestrator/Modelfile`. Candidate runtime `ric-orchestrator-candidate:008a` was created and passed six focused vocabulary smoke tests with 6 PASS and 0 FAIL, including the push blocked exact label `PUSH AINDA BLOQUEADO`. The official runtime was not promoted or overwritten.

RIC-STUDIO-009A is in REVIEW. READY remains empty. Local DONE and Remote DONE are not declared for RIC-STUDIO-009A.

`ric-orchestrator-candidate:008a` was promoted locally to `ric-orchestrator-runtime:latest`. Official runtime smoke tests passed with 3 PASS and 0 FAIL. The Modelfile was not edited, candidates `005a` and `008a` were not deleted, and no scripts, dependencies, UI/app files, Git automation, commit, or push occurred.

UI, Next.js app, IDE integration, Git automation, GitHub API integration, database, login, deploy, scripts, runtime source changes, Modelfile edits, model training, model tuning, dependency changes, runtime deletion, commit, and push are blocked.
